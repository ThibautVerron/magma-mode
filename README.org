* Magma-mode
[[http://melpa.org/#/magma-mode][file:http://melpa.org/packages/magma-mode-badge.svg]]

** Basics

This is a mode for editting input files for the computer algebra
software [[magma][Magma]] in emacs.

It is based on the [[magma-mode]] written by Luk Bettale.  The font-lock
(syntax highlight) specifications were taken from this mode, as well
as the interaction with a magma process through term-mode.

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome, please use the github issue tracker. 
Contributions are more than welcome, feel free to clone the =dev= branch and start hacking!

** Installation instructions

*** With Melpa (regular usage)

magma-mode is on [[http://melpa.org/#/][melpa]], so you can install it with:

1. =M-x package-install magma-mode=

2. Add =(require 'magma-mode)= to your init file.

*** With Git (regular usage or contribution)

1. Clone the repository in your favorite elisp folder

   #+begin_src shell-script
      cd $favoriteElispFolder
      git clone https://github.com/ThibautVerron/magma-mode.git
   #+end_src    

2. Make sure that the required packages [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] (library for managing
   filenames) and [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]] (library for managing lists) are installed.
   
3. Add the following to your emacs init file :

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "<FavoriteElispFolder>/magma-mode")
      (require 'magma-mode "<FavoriteElispFolder>/magma-mode/magma-mode.el")
      ;; Or simply (require 'magma-mode) if you aren't using any other magma-mode
   #+end_src

*** Additional setup:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp 
     ;; If you want to load the mode automatically with some file extensions
     (setq auto-mode-alist
     (append '(("\\.mgm$\\|\\.m$" . magma-mode))
             auto-mode-alist))
          
   #+end_src
   
If you want to use auto-completion against magma keywords, please see the next section. 

** Completion
*** Introduction
    A basic completion engine is provided, to be used in the magma
    editting window, or in a magma interactive buffer using comint.

    At the moment, it provides completion based on a dictionary. This
    dictionary is not included at the moment, but if you need to build
    it, we provide a script for doing so (linux only).

    This dictionary is updated with definitions from the current
    buffer, and from externally loaded files (using the =load= magma
    primitive).

*** Building the dictionary
    The =bin= folder contains a script named
    =build_completion_table.sh=. It is very basic, and the usage is
    quite constrained.

    The easiest case is the case where you are using =emacs= on a
    machine running =magma=. 
    
    In this case, follow these instructions:
    1. Find your magma installation directory;
    2. Place yourself in the =magma-mode= directory;
    3. Run the script:

       #+begin_src shell-script
         .../magma-mode$ bin/build_completion_table.sh $pathtomagma
       #+end_src

    4. The completion table will be in =data/magma_symbols.txt=
    
    In case you are running emacs on a different machine than the one
    running magma, the easiest way is to first create a fake
    documentation. Run the following on the magma machine:

    #+begin_src shell-script
      cd $pathtomagma/doc/html
      
      cat *.htm > ~/.magmadoc.htm
    #+end_src

    Then on the emacs machine:

    #+begin_src shell-script
       mkdir -p .tmpmagma/doc/html
     
       scp $magmamachine:.magmadoc.htm .tmpmagma/doc/html/
      
       cd .tmpmagma
    #+end_src
    
    then follow the above instructions to build the completion table,
    but use =~/.tmpmagma/= as the path to the magma installation.
    
    Afterwards, you can remove the directory =.tmpmagma= and the file =magmadoc.htm=.

*** Invoking the completion

    In =magma-mode= and =magma-comint-interactive-mode=, the
    dictionary provides completion candidates for =completion-at-point=. 
    In =magma-comint-interactive-mode=,
    =completion-at-point= is bound to =TAB=, and in =magma-mode= it
    is not bound to any key by default. 

    In =magma-term-interactive-mode= (with =term-char-mode=),
    completion is supported out of the box by magma itself.

*** Limitations

    Context-dependent completion is not supported at the moment.

    The dictionary is only updated with function, procedure and
    intrinsics definitions. If there are requests to be able to 
    complete variable names, it may be implemented in the future.
    However, without proper scoping, it would probably not be very useful.

** Keymap and functions
*** Managing magma processes

| =C-c C-o= | =magma-switch-to-interactive-buffer-same-frame= | start an interactive magma process, in the same frame and in a different window |
| =C-c o=   | =magma-switch-to-interactive-buffer=            | start an interactive magma process in a different frame                         |
| =C-c C-k= | =magma-kill=                                    | kill the magma process                                                          |
| =C-c C-i= | =magma-int=                                     | interrupt the magma process                                                     |
| =C-c C-a= | =magma-restart=                                 | restart the magma process                                                       |

*** Evaluation of expressions

| =C-c C-e= | =magma-eval=              | send the expression at point to the magma-process                                                  |
| =C-c C-l= | =magma-eval-line=         | send the current line to the magma process                                                         |
| =C-c C-r= | =magma-eval-region=       | send the current region to the magma process                                                       |
| =C-c C-b= | =magma-eval-buffer=       | send the content of current buffer to the magma process                                            |
| =C-c C-u= | =magma-eval-until=        | send the content of the current buffer, until the point, to the magma process                      |
| =C-c C-f= | =magma-eval-defun=        | with point in a function definition, send it to the magma process                                  |
| =C-c C-p= | =magma-eval-paragraph=    | send the current block to the magma process                                                        |
| =C-c :=   | =magma-send-expression=   | prompt for an expression, send it to the magma process                                             |
| =C-c C-w= | =magma-show-word=         | evaluate the variable at point in the magma buffer                                                 |
| =C-c h=   | =magma-help-word=         | prompt for a symbol, and display the available documentation about that symbol in the magma buffer |
| =C-c C-h= | =magma-help-word-browser= | searches the online documentation                                                                  |

Additionally, all these functions take optional prefix arguments:

 - =C-u 3 C-l= : send the current line to the magma process number 3
 - =C-u C-l= : prompts for a magma process, and send the current line
   to this process
 - =C-u C-u C-l= : send the current line to all magma processes
   
The function =magma-comint-send-now= (not bound by default) is a bit
special: it prompts for a value, then sends it to the magma
evaluation buffer /without/ waiting for the evaluation queue to be
empty. It allows to send values to interactive prompts (=read= or
=readi=) without switching buffers.

| =magma-use-electric-newline=         | =nil=                        | See the "Extras" section below                |

*** Comint vs term

=Term-mode= will basically render the magma experience you would have
in a regular terminal emulator, regardless of emacs. The buffer is
read-only except for the prompt, =C-p= and =C-n= browse the history
instead of scrolling the window, /et caetera/.

Another specificity of term-mode is that it intercepts some prefix
keys, most notably =C-c= and =C-x=. For most purposes, =C-x= needs to
be replaced with =C-c=.  So for example, if you need to switch from
your magma code buffer to the magma process buffer, then switch back,
you'll first press =C-x o= (=other-window=), then =C-c o=.

This can be changed by turning on =term-line-mode= (=C-c C-j=), but
this changes the behavior of =term-mode= way beyond the mere
interception of signal keys. To change back to the regular behavior,
turn on =term-char-mode= (=C-x C-k=). Another option is to use =C-c o=
(=magma-switch-to-interactive-buffer-same-frame=) instead of =C-x o=
in the editting window.

On the other hand, =comint-mode= spawns an interactive process in a
full-featured emacs buffer. You can scroll using the usual keys, you
can edit the output of previous commands... It is mostly equivalent to
=term-mode= with =term-line-mode=, but in my experience, it suffers
from less minor bugs.

Another point to note is that =term-mode= sends input to a terminal,
and =magma= is run in that terminal. Getting the whole thing to run
under different systems (windows...) can prove tricky. On the other
hand, =comint= starts the magma process directly from emacs, and does
not depend on anything apart from emacs and =magma=.

As of today, =term-mode= is disabled by default and no longer
maintained (it still works, but it won't recieve new features). It may
be removed in the future, so please create an issue if your workflow
absolutely requires that you use =term-mode= instead of =comint=.


*** Methods for sending input to the magma buffer

The =magma-mode= supports three ways of sending large blocks of input
to the magma buffer, and this is controlled with the variable
=magma-interactive-method=:
 - =whole= : the input is passed without any modification to the
   magma buffer;
 - =expr= : the input is cut in magma expressions, and then sent to
   the magma buffer;
 - =line= (default) : the input is sent to the magma buffer
   line-per-line. 

This variable has no noticeable effect in most cases, but on very
large inputs (for example =magma-eval-buffer= in a large buffer),
sending the input as a whole will cause =comint= or =term= to cut the
input at arbitrary locations, effectively confusing =magma=. Cutting
at end of lines or end of expressions helps ensuring that what is
sent to magma makes sense.

Additionally, the variable =magma-interactive-wait-between-inputs=
controls whether we want to wait for magma to output before sending
the next line of input. With the latest version, the default is =t=. 
If you experience a noticeable slowdown for large buffers, you can 
try setting it to =nil=.

Note that, if using =comint= and due to the way magma processes its
input, if this option is set to =nil=, in the magma buffer, the
results will no longer be correlated to their input.

The function =magma-eval-buffer= obeys to one more variable 
=magma-interactive-use-load=: if set to =t=, =magma-eval-buffer= will 
try to evaluate the buffer by sending =load <filename>;=.

** Extras

All the features described in this section are disabled by default.

*** Support for extra modes

The file =magma-extra.el= provides support for various minor modes:
 - =hs-minor-mode= : folding of =keyword=... =end keyword;=
   blocks. It probably will not work correctly in case the code is
   not syntactically correct (unclosed blocks);
 - =imenu= : implemented the backend functions, so that code
   navigation and =which-function= should work fine. At the moment,
   the defun syntax =foo :== =function (bar)=... =end function;= is not
   supported;
 - =smart-parens= : partial support only, it is mainly a function
   trying to ensure that the second =>= in =hom<A -> B >= is matched
   to the opening =<=. 

To use these features, simply turn the corresponding modes on.

*** Yasnippet snippets

=magma-mode= comes with a small collection of snippets. At the moment, we
provide snippets for =case=, =for=, =if=, =try=, =while=, =function=,
=procedure=, and =load= (with filename completion).

To use this, add the following to your init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'magma-snippets)
#+end_src

*** Extra "electric" editting features

The following functions are available:
    
 - =magma-insert-newline=: inserts a visual
   newline in the buffer. It is a regular =newline-and-indent= in most
   situations, but if the point is in the middle of the string, it
   cuts the string in half before inserting the newline.

   Example: (the [] indicates the point)

   #+begin_example
      x := "a long sentence, really, a long sentence, [a]nd even a few more words";
      
      <RET> --->
      
      x := "a long sentence, really, a long sentence, "
      cat "and even a few more words";
   #+end_example
    
   This shouldn't change the way your code is evaluated.

 - =magma-insert-special-newline==: inserts
   a "stronger" newline in the buffer. It is a regular
   =newline-and-indent= in most situations, but in a comment, it will
   assume that you want to continue the comment in the next line:

   #+begin_example  
      // Comment []
      
      <C-RET> --->
      
      // Comment 
      // []
   #+end_example

   and in a string, it will insert an explicit newline character:

   #+begin_example 
      x := "a long sentence, really, a long sentence, [a]nd even a few more words";
      
      <RET> --->
      
      x := "a long sentence, really, a long sentence, \\n"
      cat "and even a few more words";"
   #+end_example

Simply bind them to keys of your choice if you wish to use them.
For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key magma-mode-map (kbd "RET") #'magma-insert-newline)
(define-key magma-mode-map (kbd "C-RET") #'magma-insert-special-newline)
#+end_src

*** Initial file contents and file headers

We offer support for initial file contents and automatically updated
headers. To use them, set the variables =magma-initial-file= and
=magma-file-header= to either =\'default= (remove the backslash) or a function name, which
then replaces the default function for inserting the default content
or updating it.

Additionally, you should activate =auto-insert= for magma:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'magma-mode-hook 'auto-insert)
#+end_src

The header inserted by the default functions looks like this:

#+begin_src c
  // Created: Sun Mar 16 13:31:33 2014
  // Last modified: Thu Apr 17 11:35:26 2014
  // Hash: bb0dadd0604bafdaa20282285c2d85ff
  // load "filename.m";
#+end_src

** Changelog
*** 2015-09-23

 - *Bugfix* Error in process filter if the buffer is too short
 - *New feature* Emacs now attempts to set the working directory of
   magma (accessible through =GetWorkingDirectory()=, relevant for
   =load= instructions). This will be either =magma-default-directory=
   if not nil, or the directory of the buffer if the buffer has a
   file, or the user's home directory. When running magma on a remote
   system with a different filesystem, you will probably have to set
   =magma-default-directory= to a non-nil value.
 - *Change* =magma-default-directory= now defaults to =nil= (instead
   of the user's home directory). 

*** 2015-09-13

 - *Bugfix* Sometimes some text would get stuck before the prompt, and
   the magma buffer would hang
 - *Bugfix* Cleaner detection of the deleted reecho (=print "> ";=
   should work as expected now)
 - *Change* Electric newline features are no longer controlled by a
   variable, bind the keys manually if you wish to use them. (The
   original behavior was making it too hard for a user to bind the
   keys to some other function in the global keymap)

*** 2015-07-11 (hotfix)

 - *Bugfix* Evaluation would miss the semicolon for lines not ending
   with a newline

*** 2015-07-08 (hotfix)
 
 - *Bugfix* The SMIE parser was failing to jump from inside sexps.

*** 2015-07-06

 - *Bugfix* The SMIE parser was failing to jump over sexps
 - *Bugfix* During evaluation, stripped comments were added to the
   kill-ring
 - *Bugfix* Indent =repeat ... until= statements
 - *Bugfix* On some occasions, empty lines would cause the evaluation
   to hang
 - *Bugfix* Compilation errors. Support for smartparens is improved.
 - *Bugfix* The parser would misbehave at the beginning of the buffer
 - *Bugfix* Safer completion when point is inappropriate
   
*** 2015-06-04

 - *Bugfix* Indentation for the arguments or =printf= and =vprintf=
 - *Bugfix* Improved performance in some indentation/parsing helpers
 - *Bugfix* Users were prompted for a void auto-insert
 - *Bugfix* Keybindings not matching the documentation

*** 2015-03-12

 - *Bugfix* When =magma-interactive-method= is set to =line= and
   several instructions are on the same line, =C-c C-e= will evaluate
   them all.
 - *Bugfix* Minor formatting tweaks for the timer on the modeline
   
*** 2015-02-18

 - *New feature* Mode-line indicator for interactive buffer now shows
   whether the buffer is ready or running some computation. If
   running, also show the time since last input was sent.
 - *New feature* Errors in the interactive buffer are highlighted and
   link back to the source. (Note: this feature is still experimental,
   in particular source file name detection still does not work in all
   cases)
 - *New feature* Added the function =magma-comint-send-now= 
 - *Change* In some situations, the magma interactive buffer failed to
   acknowledge that it is ready for more input. It should happen more
   rarely now. If it still happens, as a workaround, =C-c C-i=
   (=magma-int=) will now force the input queue to be emptied.
 - *Change* Indentation in parenthesed structures is more consistent.
 - *Change* =magma-working-buffer-number= can be set as a file local
   variable, and its value is assumed to be safe if it is a number, a
   char or a string. If it is a symbol, the user is prompted to
   confirm that it is a safe value, and the symbol is evaluated.
 - *Bugfix* Indentation after, and inside =<...>=
 - *Bugfix* Changing the working buffer locally was not easy, now
   there is a function =magma-set-working-buffer-locally=.
 - *Bugfix* =magma-eval-until= would evaluate up to the next
   expression if point was at the end of an expression. 
 - *Bugfix* Evaluation functions no longer push the comments in the
   evaluated region to the kill ring.

*** 2014-11-19

 - *Change* =comint-mode= is made the default mode
 - *Change* Step-by-step evaluation mechanism changed, no more hardcoded waiting time between instructions
 - *Bugfix* Incorrect indentation in some situations
 - *Bugfix* Performance improvement when scanning the buffer for new completion candidates (noticeable in the interactive buffer)
 - *Bugfix* The smie parser was unable to get out of strings
 - *Bugfix* =build-completion-table.sh= was ignoring some functions
