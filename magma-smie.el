;; Here we describe the smie grammar for the magma language. Some
;; tokens are ambiguous, we ask the lexer to lift the ambiguity and
;; pass unique "phony" token names to the parser. These token names
;; are all prefixed with '', so that in case they appear verbatim in
;; a magma buffer, the lexer will not pick them as tokens: by default,
;; the lexer picks "\w+" matches as token, and '' is not a word
;; consistuant. (Proof : place the point at "token" above, then press
;; `C-M-s' and enter "\w". Check that the '' is not highlighted amongst
;; the matches)
