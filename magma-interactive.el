  send it in batches. In this case, it will cut it
  at (apparently) random points, which may cause syntax errors, if
  the break is in the middle of an identifier for example;
- if `line', send the region one line at a time;
- if `expr', send the region one expr at a time;
- if `file', copy the region to a temporary file and use \"load ...;\" to evaluate it in magma. 

Additionally, if `magma-interactive-wait-between-inputs' is non
nil, and if `magma-interactive-method' is either `line' or
`expr', emacs will wait until magma has processed the input
